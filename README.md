# packages

Internal packages used by the Botpress team accross multiple repositories.

These packages are not meant for our community. Since the packages are catered to our own use-cases, they might have less stable APIs, receive breaking changes without much warning, have minimal documentation and lack community-focused support. However, they were still left intentionally public for an important reason : **We Love Open-Source**.

Therefore, if you wish to install or fork any of these packages feel absolutly free to do it. We strongly recommend that you tag your versions properly.

## Licensing

All packages in this repository are open-source software and licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). By contributing in this repository, you agree to release your code under this license as well.
